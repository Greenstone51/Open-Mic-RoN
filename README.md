Overview
This AutoHotkey script allows you to toggle push-to-talk (PTT) voice chat in Ready or Not, where native toggle functionality is currently limited (as far as I know).
Instead of having to hold a key like J the whole time, this script lets you toggle it on/off using a custom key (like V by default).



How to Use

1. Requirements
    AutoHotkey ﻿v1.1 must be installed on your PC﻿.


2. Setup﻿
    ﻿Download the .exe/.ahk script and save it anywhere.
    Double-click the file to run it.
    You'll be asked to:
    Choose a toggle key (e.g. V)
    Choose your in-game PTT key (e.g. J)



3. Usage﻿
    Press your toggle key (e.g. V) to activate/deactivate voice chat.
    The system tray tooltip will show whether VC is enabled or disabled.
    Press Ctrl + PTT Key (e.g. Ctrl + J) to safely exit the script.



Notes
    Make sure your in-game voice bind matches what you enter into the script.
    This script works globally but is designed for use with Ready or Not.﻿
    The script uses very minimal resources and runs in the background (System Tray).
